# AI PPTX Translator

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9%2B-blue.svg)

Uses the latest Google GenAI models on LangChain to automate translation of Powerpoint decks into multiple languages.

## Description

I built this because it takes too much time to translate stuff at work. You will obviously have to resize the text boxes. 



## Dependencies
```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
